    "summary": "I’m a 4th year PhD Student in computer science at Imperial College London. My research interests lie within virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), and AI. I conduct research in VR/AR and train and evaluate behavioral inference models aimed to power Intelligent user interfaces and support collaboration and productivity in VR/AR. Previously I worked on 3D web customizers for the 3D printing industry. I enjoy working in a multi-disciplinary team and aim to use technology to help people.",
